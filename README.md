# TerminalPeriodicTable
Terminal-based Periodic Table written in C++

## Getting Started
To run the project, make sure you have the libcurl library installed.
1. Change file names to the correct locations (mine was installed at ./Desktop/Useful\ Stuff/Coding/programs/PeriodicTable/, the file locations may need to be changed in the ElementsOutput/ElementsInput).
2. Run the makefile inside the project to compile it (i.e. cd /path/to/folder/, make).
3. Run ./periodic_table.

Note that my folder name was PeriodicTable, and not TerminalPeriodicTable.

### Prerequisites
The libcurl library, c++11 or later. I have only tested this on Mac OS X 10.10, so it may likely work on Linux or later versions of Mac OS X, but I cannot guarantee.
